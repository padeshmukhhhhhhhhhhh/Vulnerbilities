# what is Business logic flows
  Business logic vulnerabilities are flaws in the design and implementation of an application that
    allow an attacker to elicit unintended behavior.This potentially enables attackers to manipulate legitimate functionality 
    to achieve a malicious goal. These flaws are generally the result of failing to anticipate unusual application states that may occur and, consequently, failing to handle them safely.

 #  the impact of business logic vulnerabilities
   The impact of business logic vulnerabilities can, at times, be fairly trivial. 
   It is a broad category and the impact is highly variable. However, any unintended behavior can potentially lead to high-severity attacks if an attacker is able to manipulate the application in the right way. For this reason, quirky logic should ideally be fixed even if you can't work out how to exploit it yourself. There is always a risk that someone else will be able to.

   Can not find any functionality on website to test business logic flows.
